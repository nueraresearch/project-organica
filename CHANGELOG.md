# Changelog

All notable changes to Project Organica are recorded here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and the project follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/).

## Versioning in this repository — three separate namespaces

The words "v1" and "v2" appear in this project in three different senses.
They are deliberately distinct, and they are what the version number
*does not* refer to.

| Namespace | Form | Meaning | Current |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Package version** | `0.x.y` (SemVer 2) | the released, installable, citable artifact | **0.6.0** |
| **Architecture generation** | *Organica 1*, *Organica 2* | a generation of the eight-layer engine. Organica 1 is frozen; Organica 2 is planned | **Organica 1** |
| **Research campaign** | *Ablation Study 1*, *Ablation Study 2* | the experimental series. Study 1 is the eleven-condition ablation; Study 2 is the six-colony Tier-1 matrix | **Study 2 in flight** |

The package version is **pre-1.0**, which is the honest state: the public
API is not declared stable, and the MINOR/PATCH numbers carry the
meaning instead. `tests/test_versioning.py` asserts that the three
declarations — `organica.__version__`, `pyproject.toml` and `CITATION.cff`
— never drift apart, and that a git tag exists for the version.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-10-23

> **0.6.0 is the first release of this repository to carry a git tag.**
> The versions below were published to this repository without tags, so they
> are recorded here as history but cannot be checked out as named commits.
> The tag convention starts here: releases are tagged `v<version>`, and
> `tests/test_versioning.py` fails the build if the version has no tag.

**Milestone M0.5 — mechanism closure, and a substrate correction.**

This release changes the organism's behaviour. It is a pre-1.0 release
because the public API is not stable, but the behavioural change is
real and is disclosed in full in `research-journal/phase_g_findings_20261021.md`
§21.8 and `docs/USER-MANUAL.md` §8.4.

### Changed — substrate

- **The tag-frequency counter is now scoped to world events.** It was
  maintained over every stored event, including the organism's own sleep
  payloads, while the co-occurrence and temporal graphs it normalises are
  built from world events only. The counter is the *denominator* of the
  Layer-1 edge strength (`ratio = count / source_freq`), so the two sides
  of the ratio measured different populations and the survival filter
  discarded the world's own structure. Measured: 4 surviving edges, 0
  processes, 0 workflows, 0 beliefs.
- A `meta` table records the scope the counters were built with, so a
  database written by an older build rebuilds its counter exactly once
  instead of mixing two populations in one table.

### Added

- `docs/FORCE-MATRIX-PREREGISTRATION.md` — M1–M9 frozen, plus the launch
  gates G-CS, G-P1, G-SUP, G-EXP and G-SUS.
- `docs/ORGANICA-V2-DESIGN-NOTES.md` — planning only: what survived
  scrutiny, what failed, what turned out inert, what turned out essential,
  what became a bottleneck, and the open questions.
- `docs/gate_validation.json`, `docs/mbsd_census.json`,
  `docs/mbsd_census_postfix.json`, `docs/gate_check.json`,
  `docs/freq_scope_probe.json`, `docs/metric_sensitivity.json`,
  `docs/force_matrix_pilot.json`.
- `organica/branch_streams.py` — branch-structured stimuli built from
  triangles, derived from the measured mechanism.
- Benchmarks: `gate_validation.py`, `mbsd_census.py`, `branch_sweep.py`,
  `branch_sweep2.py`, `branch_diag.py`, `branch_diag2.py`,
  `freq_scope_probe.py`, `gate_check.py`, `force_matrix.py`,
  `metric_sensitivity.py`, `seed_noise.py`, `v1_impact.py`,
  `figure_campaign.py`.
- `tests/test_substrate_equivalence.py` — a scope-consistency regression
  test: a sleep payload must change neither the temporal graph nor the
  frequency counter that normalises it.
- `tests/test_versioning.py` — the version declarations must agree, must
  be SemVer 2, must be pre-1.0, and must have a git tag and a changelog
  entry.
- `run_continuous.py` writes `freq_scope=world` in its build marker, so
  the append-only log says which substrate produced which cycles.

### Changed — research findings

- **The proposed Multi-Belief Subject Density gate is structural, not
  predictive.** Layer 5 forms exactly one theory per subject holding ≥ 2
  beliefs; the identity `theories == min(competing_subjects, MAX_THEORIES)`
  holds in 100% of cycles in 9 of the 11 conditions. The gate is restated
  as an absolute count.
- **The `r=4 / r=6 / r=10` "phase transition" was an instrumentation
  artifact.** With the counter scoped correctly, all three repeat counts
  behave identically: a full prediction window, a belief pool of 18, seven
  competing subjects, and 100% of tail cycles passing every gate.
- **"No Falsification freezes the organism" is withdrawn.** Post-fix it is
  the best-supplied condition in the study: 18 beliefs, 6 of 6 subjects
  competing, MBSD 1.000.
- **"The organism is supply-limited, not selection-limited" is withdrawn as
  a general statement.** It was true of the study stream on the old
  substrate; on a branch-structured stimulus the cap binds and the
  retention policy changes the population.
- Facts sheet D8b is **corrected in place**; D8c–D8e are added.

### Fixed

- The G1–G4 perturbation ladder caught a measurement reading the wrong
  report attribute and reporting a working layer as dead (previously
  corrected, recorded here for the release history).
- The campaign runner instantiated the instrument instead of the colony
  subclass, which made every colony run the default service and produced
  a byte-identical FULL and SALIENCE. The runner now asserts G1 — that
  each colony's intervention is in the code path — before running a
  colony.

### Known limitations

- The ablation study in `docs/ablation_study.json` was produced on the
  **pre-fix** substrate. Every condition ran on the same substrate, so
  the comparisons stand, but the absolute densities are not comparable to
  post-fix numbers. `benchmarks/v1_impact.py` produces the before/after
  audit (`docs/v1_impact.json`).
- One seed per colony. Deltas smaller than the measured seed-noise floor
  are reported as *not interpretable*. The floor is measured by
  `benchmarks/seed_noise.py`.

## 0.5.0 — 2026-10-21

- Phase G endurance work: monotonic sleep-cycle counter in the database,
  bounded candidate retention, the tag-frequency counter moved from a
  full-table scan to an incremental counter.
- `docs/USER-MANUAL.md` rewritten with 18 sections.
- `docs/FACTS-SHEET.md` — facts with provenance, separated from assumptions.
- `docs/GATE-BOARD.md` — what is demonstrated versus assumed.
- `benchmarks/clone_check.py` and a passing fresh-clone check.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-10-20

- Observation pipeline repaired; `MemoryService.batch()` added after
  profiling found one fsync per candidate dominated the cycle
  (1,023 commits = 3.0 s of a 4.5 s cycle).
- `benchmarks/cold_start.py` — the eight assistance levels.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-10-20

- The eight-layer engine, the four reproduction domains, the reproduction
  pack and the growth benchmarks.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-10-19

- The study daemon, the append-only log format, and the snapshot writers.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-19

- First public release of the substrate and the sleep pipeline.
