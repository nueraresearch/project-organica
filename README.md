# Project Organica

> **A Developmental Machine Intelligence.**  
> Growing intelligence from memory, structure, sleep, curiosity, and experimentation rather than pre-trained weights.

## The Vision

Most modern AI architectures follow a top-down paradigm:
$$\text{Foundation Model (Trillions of parameters)} \longrightarrow \text{Fine-Tuning} \longrightarrow \text{Tools / Memory bolted on}$$

**Project Organica reverses this order:**
$$\text{Memory First} \longrightarrow \text{Experience} \longrightarrow \text{Sleep} \longrightarrow \text{Structural Synthesis} \longrightarrow \text{Emergent Epistemology}$$

Organica begins dumb, minimal, and lightweight. It contains zero pre-trained neural networks and zero hard-coded natural language rules. It is designed like a digital infant: an organism whose cognitive capabilities emerge through repeated cycles of waking experience, graph consolidation during sleep, hypothesis formation, structural curiosity, and active experimentation.

## Core Principles

1. **Every Generation Emerges from Previous Generations**  
   New cognitive capabilities are never manually hardcoded. Every higher-order structure ($N+1$) is synthesized strictly from structures produced by layer $N$.
2. **Sleep Never Explains — It Only Creates Structures**  
   Sleep is not an LLM summarizer or chat prompt. It is a graph transformation and natural selection process that emits discrete, typed candidate nodes with explicit numeric provenance.
3. **Native Genealogical Lineage**  
   Every abstract workflow, hypothesis, question, and dream maintains 100% verified ancestral parent links down to raw experience events.
4. **Natural Selection & Falsifiability**  
   Candidates must earn their survival. Confirmed structures strengthen; unreinforced structures decay; refuted structures go extinct.
5. **The Attention Economy**  
   Importance is not confidence. Importance is **Expected Information Gain (EIG)**. The organism prioritizes its curiosity and investigation agenda toward resolving maximal uncertainty.

## The Developmental Ladder

```
[Gen 0] Events (Experience Stream)
  ↓
[Gen 1] Concepts, Predictions & Loops (Spatial & Temporal Topology)
  ↓
[Gen 2] Process Candidates & Meta-Concepts (Composite Sequences & Structural Anchors)
  ↓
[Gen 3] Workflow Concepts (Multi-Anchor Cycles)
  ↓
[Gen 4] Hypothesis Candidates (Falsifiable Causal Expectations)
  ↓
[Gen 5] Theory & Question Candidates (Dialectic Tension & Curiosity)
  ↓
[Gen 6] Categorized Dreams (Completion, Analogy, Mutation, Conditional)
  ↓
[Gen 7] Investigation Candidates (Ranked by Expected Information Gain)
  ↓
[Gen 8] Experiments (Active Probing & Intervention) [In Progress]
```

## Quickstart

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nueraresearch/project-organica.git
cd project-organica

# (optional) Install dependencies – Flask for the Inception API, Streamlit for the UI
pip install -r requirements.txt  # ensure flask, streamlit, requests are listed

# 1️⃣ Start the continuous Organica daemon (already running as a background task)
#    If it stopped, you can relaunch it:
python run_continuous.py &

# 2️⃣ Launch the Inception API (exposes health metrics and accepts injection payloads)
python inception_api.py &

# 3️⃣ Open the Health Dashboard & Inception Control UI
streamlit run dashboard_ui.py
```

The UI shows the latest health metrics and provides a sidebar where you can:
- Select a predefined *seed* (e.g., Auth Failure, Contradictory Belief, Dream Trigger).
- Paste a custom JSON payload.
- Send the payload to the Inception endpoint (`/inception`).

Snapshots of the current metrics can be saved via the **Create JSON snapshot** button.


```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nueraresearch/project-organica.git
cd project-organica

# Run Sleep V5 (Curiosity & Investigation Agenda)
python examples/v4_curiosity_dreams_eig.py
```
